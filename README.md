This repository contains scripts developed for my diploma dissertation, *"Image Synthesis of the Digital Environment Considering the Influence of Temperature on Light Ray Paths."* 
You can check out the related project [here](https://github.com/ReasonPsycho/UnrealEngineSkyAtmosphere-Mirage).  

## Contents:  
- A simplified path tracer that visualizes light paths using a graph  
- A script for generating a height map based on two geographical coordinates
- A script for downloading satellite images based on two geographical coordinates  
- A script for saving a linear temperature map as a texture
